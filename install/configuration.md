# Configuration

The **config.yml** file will be created on the first server startup.

The config file *should* automatically update with the new additions added in an update.

## Descriptions
`announcements`

The part of the config that controls the announcements from the plugin developer to servers OPs and Owners.

This can be used in a few instances such as letting them know of an important bug to be aware of, if there's an update ready to go, or general messages that the developer finds important for the users to know.

**Example**
```YAML
console: true
in-game: true
```

`messagesLanguage`

Choosing your language for the plugin is pretty simple. In the language folder (`/Guilds/languages/`), you can see a list of all the languages that are currently in the plugin. Please understand that not all languages are fully translated, but you can finish a translation and submit it if interested!

**Example**
```YAML
messagesLanguage: en-US
```
