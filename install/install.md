# Installation

## First-Time Setup

1) Download the latest `Guilds-x.x.jar` file from either the SpigotMC page or the development build page. You can find the latest version from SpigotMC [right here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/48920/)!
2) Locate your server's plugin directory, then place the Guilds jar you grabbed in the previous step into that folder!
3) Start your server and then step it again so that the plugin can generate all the data it needs to. You can now find the config in `/Guilds/config.yml`!
4) Make any chances you need to the config, then save it.
5) Start the server back up and you'll be ready to rock and roll!
