# Installation

1. Make sure your server it <b>off</b> before continuing.
2. Go to the [spigot page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/48920/) and click on "Download Now" to get the latest version of the plugin.
3. Locate the downloaded jar file and place it in your server's plugins folder.
4. Start the server back up and ensure everything is running fine.

## Configuration
Once the installation has completed, make sure you follow the last step and start the server back up.

Once the server has been started, the jar file will create a folder in your server's plugins folder called "Guilds".

The folder created by the jar will contain all the data for the plugin including the configuration file, the guild data, and the language files.
