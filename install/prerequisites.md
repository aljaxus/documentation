# Prerequisites
Guilds can run on pretty much any platform that supports Bukkit. Please don't hold me to that as only the following environments have been tested thoroughly:
* Spigot 1.7 - 1.13
* Paper 1.7-1.13

**CPU:** The plugin will run perfectly fine on basically any CPU. It's optimized to be smooth and non-intensive to the server it runs on.

**RAM:** Guilds uses fairly little RAM. You should expect to see a use of about `256MB` on startup and depending on how many Guilds you have, it could use up to 2GB.

**Disk Space**: Guilds uses very little space. It's optimized to keep itself to a single JSON file along with the addition of the config file and all the translations. You shouldn't need more than `10MB` of space to run properly.

## Required Plugins
Since Guilds handles a lot of work with economy and permissions, the plugin does depend upon [Vualt](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/34315/).
