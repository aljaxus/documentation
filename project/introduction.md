# Introduction

Guilds was created to offer an RPG-type system to servers. It was inspired by players like you who enjoy creating a fun, exciting, and adventurous environment for your server. Guilds allow players to join interactive groups of other players, make their own communities on your server, and have a general fun time!

## Supported Platforms
The project supports a variety of platforms with more to come in the future.

Our core platforms that we support include the following:

* Bukkit
* Spigot
* Paper
